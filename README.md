# Computer Training
### Vue.js app I made to help my 4 year-old learn how to use a keyboard and mouse. 
### Works on mobile but the idea was to create a few simple games/activities that familiarize a new user with how to move and click a mouse, and learn the layout of a standard keyboard.

## Project setup
Clone remote repository
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
